# AI Manipulation Apart Sprint

## 🚀 *DEEB-learn*: Benchmark to quantify tonal shift from LLM response based on contextual changes

## 🌟 Overview  

- Large language models can shift tone under minor contextual framing changes  
- This complicates the evaluation of model outputs 
- We present a benchmark to quantify this shift  
- Our approach combines mechanistic interpretability insights, AI judge assembly and a classification benchmark  

## 🎯 Key Features  

- Uses multi-judge assembly to score with behavioral traits 
- Uses 2 context modifyers to study evalutation or oversight 
- Uses additional mechanistic interpretability information

## 🚀 Getting Started
